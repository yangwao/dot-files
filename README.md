# Wao's Dot Files
Technically speaking, in computing a "dot file" is a hidden directory or file on a UNIX/Linux system that are so named because they are prefixed with a full stop. Dot files within a user's home directory contain most of the user-specific configuration available on a desktop and are configured manually or through the use of tools.
